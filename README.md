# Setting up
Make sure you have `Python 3.6` or higher installed, as well as the rewrite version of `discord.py` (async version of the bot is at the `legacy` branch).
Modify the settings in the `config.json` file:
```javascript
{
  "prefix": "your command prefix here",
  "token": "your bot token here"
}
```
